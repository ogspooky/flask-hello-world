# Flask + Vercel

This example shows how to use Flask 3 on Vercel with Serverless Functions using the [Python Runtime](https://vercel.com/docs/concepts/functions/serverless-functions/runtimes/python).

## Demo

https://flask-python-template.vercel.app/

## How it Works

This example uses the Web Server Gateway Interface (WSGI) with Flask to enable handling requests on Vercel with Serverless Functions.

## Running Locally

```bash
npm i -g vercel
vercel dev
```

Your Flask application is now available at `http://localhost:3000`.

## Jackson nig setup:
1. Install WSL2 (should come with "terminal" on the windows store). This will give you a *linux shell* which you need for all dev work.
2. Install VSCode
3. Clone the repo, set up your credentials as instructed (READ)
4. You need to make a *virtual environment* to encapsulate your depencies. For example, you have many different *python packages* on your system, but the project only needs a few of them
    - `python -m venv env` # google this, this makes your virtual environment
    - `source env/bin/activate` # go *into* that env
    - `pip freeze > requirements.txt` # Saves everything installed in that env

## Useful commands
`git pull` to get new changes i have made
`git commit -am "msg"` Create a commit for *all* files with a given *message*
`git push` Push one or more commits
`pip --help | less`
`man ls`
`man git`
`vercel --help | less`
